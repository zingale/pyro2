Setting up pyro
===============

You can clone pyro from github: `http://github.com/python-hydro/pyro2 <http://github.com/python-hydro/pyro2>`_

.. note::

   It is strongly recommended that you use python 3.x.  While python 2.x might
   still work, we do not test pyro under python 2, so it may break at any time
   in the future.

The following python packages are required:

* ``numpy``
* ``matplotlib``
* ``numba``
* ``h5py``
* ``pytest`` (for unit tests)

The following steps are needed before running pyro:

* add ``pyro/`` to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable (note this is only
needed if you wish to use pyro as a python
module - this step is not necessary if you only run pyro via the
commandline using the ``pyro.py`` script).  For
  the bash shell, this is done as:

    .. code-block:: none

       export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/pyro/:${PYTHONPATH}"

* define the environment variable ``PYRO_HOME`` to point to
  the ``pyro2/`` directory (only needed for regression testing)

    .. code-block:: none

       export PYRO_HOME="/path/to/pyro/"

Quick test
----------

Run the advection solver to quickly test if things are setup correctly:

.. code-block:: none

   ./pyro.py advection smooth inputs.smooth

You should see a plot window pop up with a smooth pulse advecting
diagonally through the periodic domain.
